## Compliance Monitoring & Reporting

### Automated Compliance Checks
- **Daily**: Signature hash integrity validation
- **Weekly**: Data retention policy compliance
- **Monthly**: Access control review and user permission audit
- **Quarterly**: Full compliance report generation

### Compliance Dashboards
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Current compliance status across all requirements
2. **Trend Analysis**: Historical compliance metrics and improvement tracking
3. **Exception Reporting**: Automated alerts for compliance violations
4. **Audit Preparation**: Pre-generated reports for regulatory inspections

### Key Compliance Metrics
- **Signature Integrity**: 100% of signatures must have valid SHA-256 hashes
- **Audit Trail Completeness**: 100% of SOF changes must be logged
- **Access Control Coverage**: 100% of users must have appropriate role assignments
- **Data Retention Compliance**: 100% adherence to retention policies
- **DEA Documentation**: 100% of controlled substance SOFs must have complete DEA data

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring identifies compliance violations
2. **Classification**: Severity assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. **Response**: Immediate containment and corrective action
4. **Documentation**: Complete incident documentation for audit trail
5. **Prevention**: Root cause analysis and preventive measures

### Regulatory Change Management
